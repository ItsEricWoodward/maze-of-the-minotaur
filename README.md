## The Maze of the Minotaur

A stupid, simple Roguelike-lite designed for playing short games on your mobile phone.

Explore the maze and face the Minotaur <em>IF YOU DARE</em>!

### Purpose

This was built as part of a code challenge (_which it won_, much to my surprise!). Unfortunately, I had a hard time finding an app
that I wanted to build, so I didn't even start on it until 5 days before it was due.

The code is kind of a hot mess as a result, but I plan to clean it up some as the days (and weeks) progress.

### Technology

Built using TypeScript, powered by Vite.

### Play It Online

You can find it at https://www.itsericwoodward.com/webtoys/maze/.

### Run It Locally

1. Check out repo.
2. `npm ci`
3. `npm run dev` to test it out, or `npm run build` to build the JS (in `/dist`).

Thanks to everyone who voted for it. It means alot!

Share and enjoy!
