## The Maze of the Minotaur

A stupid, simple Roguelike-lite designed for playing short games on your mobile phone.

Explore the maze and face the Minotaur <em>IF YOU DARE</em>!

### Purpose

This was built as part of a code challenge. Unfortunately, I had a hard time finding an app
that I wanted to build, so I didn't even start on it until 5 days before it was due.

The code is kind of a hot mess asa result, but I plan to clean it as the days progress.

### Technology

Built using TypeScript, powered by Vite.
